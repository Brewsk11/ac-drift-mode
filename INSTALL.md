# Drift mode for Assetto Corsa

Install instructions for packaged mod:

1. Copy contents of `ac_gamedir` to Assetto Corsa install directory.
2. For community track and car configurations copy contents of `ac_usercfg` to your user's `Documents\Assetto Corsa` directory.
    Be careful! If you're updating the mod and you've previously created your own configurations they'll be overwritten.
